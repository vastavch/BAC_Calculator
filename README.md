# BAC_Calculator
This application is used to calculate the Blood Alcohol Container(BAC) based on a formula.For more details see README file.
BAC is calculated based on the formula ( (A * 5.14) / (weight * r) where,
     A = liquid ounces of alcohol consumed = ounces * alcohol percentage
     weight = weight in pounds
     r = a gender constant of alcohol distribution(0.73 for men and 0.66 for women)
In order to calculate the BAC,you need to enter weight in pounds and select gender(by toggling switch) and click "SAVE" button.
Then enter quantity of alcohol in ounces and alcohol percentage by dragging seek bar(it increements by 5 to a maximum of 25)
Then click "ADD DRINK" button and check BAC and status.
When you reach maximum BAC,the functionalities of application stops working except for the "RESET",which means you cannot consume alcohol anymore.
Clicking "RESET" button would allow reset the application values to default values.
When ever weight or gender is changed and "SAVE" button is clicked,the existing BAC is recalculated on the new values.
